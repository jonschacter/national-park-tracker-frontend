# National Park Tracker Frontend

National Park Tracker is a single page application built with React to allow you to view information about US National Parks, log your visits to them, leave reviews, and view other reviews.

Note: This application uses a backend repository that scrapes the NPS API for park data. Working directly with the NPS API was too slow to be practical.
